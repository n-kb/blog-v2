{"title": "The collapse of academia", "date": "April 10, 2017", "image": "Dynamo_Machine.jpg", "intro": "An essay by", "share": "Share", "text": "---\n\nOne day of April 2014, I found myself in a conference room, on the top floor of a brand new building, in a top European university. I was speaking to a group of PhDs, doctors and professors from some of Europe's most prestigious research institutions. I was part of this group because the company I worked at was a (very minor) partner in a research project with all these major scientists. I made my presentation. I explained the hypotheses we made and how we designed an experiment to test them. I explained how the results of the experiment, along with on-the-ground observation, showed that some of the assumptions of the project were probably wrong.\n\nThat's when something incredible happened. The most major researcher around the table, more diplomas that you can count, head of several groundbreaking projects in his discipline, mentor to dozens of students from around the world, spoke up. \"Can't you tell something positive at all?\" he said. He didn't ask about the methodology or about the interpretation of the results. He didn't read our conclusions. Instead, he asked us to change our results.<sup><a name='note_1' id='#note_1' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_1'>1</a></sup> He was afraid our findings would look bad on him. It's only normal. This person gets his power from the number of publicly-financed projects he manages to obtain and with which he pays his staff. Donors love when projects have very positive results - and they hate trouble. That's why this person, whose titles made him look like an eminent scientist, engaged in the most un-scientific behavior there is, which is to distort facts for personal gain.\n\nHow did we get there? How did universities, once centers of knowledge, came to reward dissimulation? That's what I tried to find out. In this essay, I'll take you through a millennium of university history, from the Middle Age all the way to the 20<sup>th</sup> century, when things got out of hand. If you make it to the very end, you'll see I offer solutions, too. Buckle up, here we go.\n\n## From centers of knowledge to suppliers of human capital\n\nThe role of universities is to \"supply human capital and incubate start-ups\", said a report authored by a several academics in 2012.<sup><a name='note_2' id='#note_2' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_2'>2</a></sup> Parliamentarians in France put it in a slightly less blunt way in 2007 when they wrote that everyone agreed the main mission of universities was to \"integrate graduates into professional life\".<sup><a name='note_3' id='#note_3' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_3'>3</a></sup> In their report, these French parliamentarians wrote a short history of universities in Europe, starting in the 12<sup>th</sup> century. For them, medieval universities trained high-ranking professionals and civil servants. It's nice that they rewrote history to make it look like their new law was the continuation of a millennial tradition but there's a caveat: it's not true.\n\nWhen Charles IV created the University of Prague in 1348, for instance, his desire was to \"satisfy the hunger of locals for knowledge\".<sup><a name='note_4' id='#note_4' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_4'>4</a></sup> Notice how he didn't mention he was \"providing the economy with efficient tradesmen\". Of course, reading documents that old is bound to provoke anachronisms. It remains that universities existed for the sake of seeking the truth. The truth, at the time, was the Bible.<sup><a name='note_5' id='#note_5' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_5'>5</a></sup> The curriculum was organized so that students would first spend a few years studying grammar, Latin and other minor topics until they were ready, at the very end, to study theology.\n\nOf course, some of the skills needed to attain theology, along with the prestige of knowledge, made medieval and modern colleges great places for the powerful to send their young ones get an education.<sup><a name='note_6' id='#note_6' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_6'>6</a></sup> Many high-ranking civil servants went through university, even though the most common way to receive an education was to hire a (university-educated) preceptor. In business and in all trades, education was carried out within corporations or guilds, where a master was responsible for an apprentice. Starting in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, university became a nice-to-have experience for the higher-ups and the bourgeoisie, along the more traditional ways of training for a job. Not to forget that banking and finance was operated by Jews (Christians didn't have the right to charge interest), who could not attend university.<sup><a name='note_7' id='#note_7' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_7'>7</a></sup>\n\nIn their first 900 years or so, universities were not businesses. They were full of poor boys that rich sponsors sent to become theologians. At times, some colleges realized that life was easier when they replaced poor, sponsored students with richer ones, but the gist of university remained: Students were there to come closer to the truth. Money or employability had nothing to do with it. In 1452 for instance, the ideal college principal at Paris university must \"eschew all forms of profit or interest\".<sup><a name='note_8' id='#note_8' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_8'>8</a></sup>\n\nThe act of studying, of trying to come closer to the truth, was so special that university staff and students had their own courts. At Paris, this exceptional jurisdiction lasted roughly 500 years, until Louis XIV decided the time had come for universities to bow to political power. In England, the privilege lasted until the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.<sup><a name='note_9' id='#note_9' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_9'>9</a></sup>\n\nThe advent of modernity, in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century, transformed universities. For one thing, the truth to be sought changed. Truth was not to be found in the Bible anymore, but through science (which had emerged in European universities as part of the lesser arts). On the other hand, universities integrated to society. Jews and women were allowed in, for instance.<sup><a name='note_10' id='#note_10' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_10'>10</a></sup> Governments started to build state universities as prestige projects.<sup><a name='note_11' id='#note_11' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_11'>11</a></sup> They also policed them more closely. Not only did they revoke their privileges, they also did not hesitate to close them down for political gain. Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, for instance, closed down the University of Warsaw, which had been founded just 15 years earlier, in an attempt to destroy Polish nationalism in 1830.<sup><a name='note_12' id='#note_12' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_12'>12</a></sup> (Two hundred years later, authoritarians keep on attacking academia to cement their power, as the ongoing closure of the Central University in Budapest and the closure of 14 universities in Turkey show.<sup><a name='note_13' id='#note_13' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_13'>13</a></sup>)\n\nDespite the dramatic changes that modernity brought in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the _purpose_ of universities remained the same: to seek the truth. There was often a utilitarian twist to it. The state with the best science could build the best military, hence the need to promote research. In the whirlwinds of the Enlightenment, one state, France, did take the radical decision of closing all universities for good, in 1793. They were replaced with rational institutions where students learned skills that were directly useful to the economy. Faculties of theology were out, schools of engineering were in. After a century of back and forth, French politicians made a remarkable discovery. They realized that total state control over academics did not help scientific progress. In 1885, the French government encouraged academics to become _more_ independent. Their reasoning was that more independent scientists would produce more and better knowledge (and improve military capabilities).<sup><a name='note_14' id='#note_14' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_14'>14</a></sup> They went back to the idea of universities as truth-seekers.\n\n## The integration of universities to the economy\n\nOver the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, universities underwent the largest transformation in their 1000-year history. The massification of higher education, most of the time at public universities, meant that universities took on the responsibility to train the larger share of the workforce. From centers dedicated to seeking the truth, whether theological or scientific, they became training operations. Students stopped going to university _primarily_ to acquire knowledge, they went there to acquire skills that would land them a job. Governments stopped looking at universities _primarily_ as producers of truth and instead started viewing them as \"providers of human capital\".\n\nThis inversion of priorities had tremendous consequences. As soon as they accepted the role of trainers of future employees, universities took on a new responsibility: training had to be adequate. The responsibility for the rise of unemployment in the 1970's necessarily fell, at least in part, on the institution that was responsible for providing the population with useful skills. Universities became a problem to fix and, as is often the case when you make the wrong diagnosis, the cures designed by politicians did more harm than good.\n\nPoliticians identified two main problems. First, universities were out of touch with the real world and could not identify the priorities of the economy. To solve this, they made funding to academics (apart from their salaries) conditional. Instead of receiving money to pursue their research, scientists must apply for grants, the topic of which have been decided by administrative staff, who, in turn, receive advice from corporations.<sup><a name='note_15' id='#note_15' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_15'>15</a></sup>  The second problem identified by politicians was that universities were inefficient. They were paid for by taxpayers and had to provide them with a good return on investment, the thinking went. The solution was thus to make universities more businesslike, tearing apart the 1452 document quoted above which forbade university principals to think of profit.\n\nThe consequences of this two-pronged approach were disastrous. So disastrous, in fact, that the very concept of truth in our society was shaken.\n\n### Corruption in research\n\nScience requires critical thinking. A theory cannot be proven right, it can only be proven wrong. As obvious as they seem, these two statements are not compatible with grants awarded by donors after a tender. A donor, whether public or private, wants to obtain results. The more sensational the results, the better. Some donors even require to proofread the results before they are published. The researcher who receives a grant but fails to provide results might reduce her chances of obtaining a grant next time. The direct consequence of this system is the abolition of critical thinking and the refusal to communicate negative findings, as I made the experience in 2014.\n\nResearch driven by grants encourages loyalty, which is not compatible with critical thinking.<sup><a name='note_16' id='#note_16' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_16'>16</a></sup> A scientist's loyalty should be to the search for the truth, not to a donor. Even if the direct falsification of results remains a relatively rare occurrence, research is corrupted in many ways. No academic will take the risk to provoke a negative finding, so experiments are rarely retested and some false theories can linger on. Scientists are ready to abandon their area of expertise to follow the topics dictated by the grant-givers.<sup><a name='note_17' id='#note_17' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_17'>17</a></sup> \n\nSeveral factors compound the moral impossibility of serving both the truth and grant-givers. Grant-givers use a series of factors to assess the success of a grant or the efficiency of a program. The number of publication is one, so that academics publish a lot of low-quality papers. The amount of press coverage can be another, pushing universities to sensationalize research or distort findings. Peer-review, the traditional gate-keeping mechanism of academia, failed to address these problems.<sup><a name='note_18' id='#note_18' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_18'>18</a></sup>\n\nThis table by Marc Edwards and Siddhartha Roy, two American researchers famous for having made clear the magnitude of the Flint water crisis, summarizes how some incentives corrupt academic work.<sup><a name='note_19' id='#note_19' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_19'>19</a></sup>\n\n![Growing Perverse Incentives in Academia](/public/images/academia.png)\n\n### The rise of the authoritarian bootlickers\n\nCorruption of research is the most dangerous consequence of the wrong diagnosis politicians made. It is also the one that received most attention. Another problem, more dangerous in the long run, concerns the people who staff academia. By rewarding loyalty over critical thinking, universities automatically promote boot-licking stooges over actual scientists. These persons, who are able to obtain money from grant-givers, control who gets what (not everyone working in academia is a public servant, many positions, especially doctoral students, depend on grant money). The mechanism is self-sustaining. These connectors are able to position themselves in a governing position in more projects because of the success of previous ones. Once in this position, they can co-author more scientific papers and rise up the ladder of the academic hierarchy.\n\nBecause the success of a project depends on the positivity of the results, the person who controls the money must make sure that none of the scientists under their control publishes - or, better: finds - results that do not go in the direction the donor intended. To be successful, these persons must act in an authoritarian manner and prevent academics under them to think critically.\n\nThe grant system puts loyalty and obedience before intellectual honesty and critical thinking. This enables authoritarian-minded persons to access positions of power and, in the meantime, weeds out those who did care for scientific research. While this mechanism might not be very visible yet (because Nobel-Prize level academics made most of their careers under a different system), it is extremely obvious for people under 40. A great many would-be scientists left academia after they realized that they had to swear allegiance to authoritarian anti-scientists ; their absence ensures that the overall quality of academia will sharply drop in the next decades. \n\n### Corruption in the institution\n\nForced by governments to be more efficient, most universities have taken to implementing business practices to maximize profit. To do so, they logically increased the number of high-paying students. In Europe, this meant enrolling as many non-Europeans as possible. International students pay roughly 15,000\u20ac a year in fees, when locals pay four or five time less.<sup><a name='note_20' id='#note_20' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_20'>20</a></sup> More subtle tricks involve setting up a license agreement in countries with a high demand for European degrees. The Sorbonne university (Paris 4), for instance, set up shop in Abu Dhabi and cashes in 15% of the fees students pay there (a whopping 50,000\u20ac for a Bachelor's degree).<sup><a name='note_21' id='#note_21' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_21'>21</a></sup>\n\nPutting money before research comes at a cost. In Abu Dhabi, for instance, the Sorbonne University remained silent when one of its lecturers was arrested and sentenced to two years in prison for having expressed an opinion that displeased the country leaders.<sup><a name='note_22' id='#note_22' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_22'>22</a></sup> In many European institutions, lecturers and professors are pressured to give good grades to high-paying students.<sup><a name='note_23' id='#note_23' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_23'>23</a></sup> Some were even charged with corruption after asking students for bribes.<sup><a name='note_24' id='#note_24' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_24'>24</a></sup>\n\nWhile this last point does not pertain to the activities of researchers in particular, I believe it has a tremendous impact on academic life. The honesty required to carry out good scientific work cannot survive in a system plagued with corruption. The value of a university's reputation only makes things worse. Because a student's degree or a professor's career depends on her university's reputation, the incentives to become whistle-blower are even lower in academia than in the corporate world.\n\n## The disappearance of the truth\n\nThe systematic corruption of research, the promotion of loyal bootlickers over good scientists and the corporate corruption at universities did not only provoke the collapse of university as an institution. As I've argued above, universities were privileged institutions where students and academics could search and preserve the truth.<sup><a name='note_25' id='#note_25' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_25'>25</a></sup> With this mission gone, truth has nowhere to hide and lies can run freely in the public discourse.<sup><a name='note_26' id='#note_26' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_26'>26</a></sup>\n\nEven academics who still carry out scientific work cannot - physically - devote time to defend the truth in public. In France, nine out of ten academic staff said they did not have the time to work properly, for instance.<note content=\"Read [L\u2019universit\u00e9 \u00e0 la recherche du temps perdu](http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/enquetes/barometre-2017-l-universite-a-la-recherche-du-temps-perdu.html\n).\"> How can a lecturer who does not have the time to perform her duties spend time blogging or meeting journalists? More importantly, now that academics have been demoted to trainers of the workforce (and inefficient ones, at that), their credibility has been hurt. Day-to-day, the constant humiliation of not receiving grants (roughly nine out of ten applications for grants fail<sup><a name='note_27' id='#note_27' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_27'>27</a></sup>) makes it psychologically difficult to take the role of defender of the truth when it comes under attack.\n\nOf course, academia in the decades past did not have a version of the truth locked up in a vault, like bullions of gold in a bank. Quite the contrary: All academics supported ideas that have been proven false since, and a few of these ideas did a lot of harm. Factual truth is constantly evolving. A fact is a fact as long as it's not been proven wrong. It's a safe bet to say that the vast majority, if not all, of today's knowledge will be tomorrow's superstitions. Truth is a process, not a fixed body of scientific papers, and it is this process of creation of factual truth that's broken.\n\nAs a result, academia could not upgrade its defenses when the mechanisms by which truth was attacked evolved in the second part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The tobacco industry was first in developing a new way to obfuscate the truth in the early 1960's. Instead of denying a scientific finding, they cast doubt upon it, saying that more research was needed before any action be taken. They also funded research in other directions in order to shift the blame and the attention on another industry. The strategy was so successful that the sugar industry used it to blame fat for obesity and the hydrocarbon giants used it again with even greater success to prevent any action on global warming. The clearest sign of the failure of academia to rise up to this challenge is that it took over 50 years for scientists to identify these mechanisms.<sup><a name='note_28' id='#note_28' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_28'>28</a></sup>\n\nThese new techniques, combined to the systemic inability of academia to confront them (how many academics still don't understand why climate change deniers think the way they do?), lowered the bar for superstitions looking to make a comeback in the public discourse. Creationism was an early candidate. Even though it was quashed in the United States in the 1960's, it has been creeping back ever since.<sup><a name='note_29' id='#note_29' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_29'>29</a></sup> Anti-vaccination movements are another example of a superstition which, although once accepted as wrong, is benefiting from the collapse of academia. The credibility of academia is so low, its means of action so ridiculous, that any theory can now prosper, however laughable. Chemtrails and the idea that cell phones cause cancer gained a wide following in the past decade, and they're far from the most irrational of these new superstitions.<sup><a name='note_30' id='#note_30' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_30'>30</a></sup>\n\nTotalitarian systems of the 20<sup>th</sup> century attacked academics as part of their war on truth. In the 21<sup>st</sup>, the collapse of truth under the weight of systemic contradictions within academia is paving the way for renewed totalitarianism. The economics of social media might have been one cause for the segmentation of the population into alternate realities.<sup><a name='note_31' id='#note_31' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_31'>31</a></sup> Had universities been strong and forward-thinking, they would have set up shop on social networks first (after all, they had e-mail in the early 1990's) and would have learned how to use them efficiently before their enemies did. The ultimate cause of the segmentation into alternate realities lies in the loss of a common platform where truth is created, debated and shared. Wikipedia was not enough to replace universities.\n\n## Solutions\n\n### End conditional funding for research\n\nGrants were put in place to prevent researchers from doing nothing. Back in the 1980's, in France, you could literally do nothing with your allocation of research money, and nobody could do anything against it.<sup><a name='note_32' id='#note_32' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_32'>32</a></sup> Now, with grants, things have changed a great deal: You have to fake time sheets and publish bogus papers in order to be able to still do nothing with grant money. And in the process, a large chuck of academia was destroyed. Was it worth it? Probably not.\n\nThe first step towards the resuscitation of academia should be the end of conditional funding, starting with grants. All researchers should receive a lump-sum amount with which to finance research. This would kill the complex, expensive and utterly useless grant-management administration and it would let researchers investigate what they feel is worthy of their time, not what politicians and their corporate friends think is.<sup><a name='note_33' id='#note_33' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_33'>33</a></sup>\n\n### Privatize higher education\n\nThe economy of the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century required that a great many people develop skills that go beyond secondary education, just like the economy of the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century required that a great many people have skills that go beyond primary education. Governments turned to universities as if they were the simple continuation of secondary schools. But they aren't. Universities are fundamentally different in that their main mission is research and thinking, not instruction. By turning universities into \"suppliers of human capital\", governments destroyed the foundations of one of the oldest European institutions and ensured their collapse.\n\nUniversities are not a place for higher education. They are a place for research. If private sector companies or public administrations want to train their future workers, they should do it themselves. The distinction between universities and higher schools for specialists (engineers, painters etc.) worked fairly well in France, between 1885, when universities were revived, and the moment universities were tasked with the instruction of millions of French youth, in the 1960's. \n\nToday, universities are so bad at training that private companies are setting up their own educational system. Apple opened an \"academy\" in Naples in 2016, where students can learn programming in a year-long curriculum.<sup><a name='note_34' id='#note_34' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_34'>34</a></sup> More interestingly, French billionaires of the dotcom bubble joined forces to create 42, a higher education institution where students become programmers in 3 years.<sup><a name='note_35' id='#note_35' class='note_anchor' href='#foot_35'>35</a></sup> In such schools, the curriculum is tailored for the needs of the businesses that stand behind them, ensuring that students find jobs _very_ easily.\n\nThat higher education be run by private corporation is not new. In journalism, many of the most prestigious schools belong to news organization. The Henri-Nannen-Schule, in Hamburg, was built to provide Gruner+Jahr, Die Zeit and Der Spiegel with new recruits. In Madrid, Unidad Editorial (which publishes _El Mundo_), has its own school, too. These examples show that a school run by a a corporation need not be inferior to one run by a university.\n\n***\n\nAbsent a radical change by European (and other) governments, higher education will probably diverge into universities that fail at training adequately and institutions run by corporations or administrations. The latter help in getting a job but can restrict the opportunities of students. At 42, for instance, students do not receive ECTS credits, preventing them from enrolling in a master's program later in their lives. At Apple Academy, it's even worse: the only programming language that is taught is developed by Apple, ensuring that they are locked in for the rest of their professional lives.\n\nUniversities should be left to what they were meant to do, which is looking for the truth. The drive to privatize them or make them more efficient should stop. Corporations and administrations should be put in charge of what they need, which is to train their future employees. And the governments should let both spheres collaborate, so that students and professionals can move from one to the other.\n\t\n\n<article class='message is-link' id='newsletter'>  <div class='message-header'>    <p>Newsletter</p>  </div>  <div class='message-body'>    <p>Write down your e-mail in the box below and you'll receive my next text directly in your inbox.</p>\n<form style='padding:3px;' action='https://tinyletter.com/nkb' method='post' target='popupwindow' onsubmit='window.open('https://tinyletter.com/nkb', 'popupwindow', 'scrollbars=yes,width=800,height=600');return true'><p><input type='text' style='width:300px' placeholder='Your e-mail address here' name='email' id='tlemail' class='input'/></p><input type='hidden' value='1' name='embed'/><input type='submit' value='Submit' class='button is-link' /></form>  </div></article>\n\n\n <a name='notes' ></a>\n\n### Notes \n\n\n\n<a href='#note_1' name='foot_1' data-text='To protect the privacy of those involved, some factual elements have been changed, but the story is true.
