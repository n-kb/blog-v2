{"title": "Why start a blog in 2015", "date": "July 22, 2015", "image": "", "intro": "An essay by", "share": "Share", "text": "---\n\nStarting a blog in 2004 was cool. Starting one in 2015 is anachronistic. But I found no other place to write more than 140 characters, use a versioning system and retain full ownership and control over form and content.\n\nI intend to use this space to write down the contents of some of my talks, but mostly to expand on conversations I have with friends. In writing, one quickly finds the gaps in reasoning -- and one must fill them or admit the weakness of an argument.\n\nBy making these thoughts public, I hope to force myself into exploring more comprehensively some of my favorite conversation topics, such as journalism, media, surveillance, nationalism, European history and agency. All posts will be edited ; I intend to use the history of commits to see how my own understanding of a problem changes through time.\n\nExcept for journalism-related topics, for which I enjoy an interesting viewpoint as a teacher and practitioner, I do not pretend to be an expert in any field. Most of what I write is probably unworthy of attention. My goal is not to convince, teach or show-off. On the contrary, it is mostly selfish: I want this blog to help me better understand some topics and the occasional reader to point the flaws in my arguments."}
